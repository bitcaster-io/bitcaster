Before we can start triggering events in Bitcaster we need to create the initial structure



Navigate to [SERVER_ADDRESS]/admin/bitcaster/organization/ to add your [Organization](organization).

!!! note

    you will find an already created OS4D Organization, you cannot edit or delete it. 
    It is used by Bitcaster.
