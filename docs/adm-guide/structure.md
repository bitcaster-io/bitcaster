Before we can start triggering events in Bitcaster we need to create the initial structure



Navigate to <https://SERVER_ADDRESS/admin/bitcaster/organization/>{: target='link' } to add your <glossary:Organization>.

!!! note

    you will find an already created OS4D Organization, you cannot edit or delete it. 
    It is used by Bitcaster.
