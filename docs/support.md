# Supporting Process

This document describes Sentryâ€™s process for handling issues that are created 
by external contributors in our public GitHub repos.


## Validate 

We use GitHub Issue Forms to strongly encourage quality reports. 
If When people give us garbage issues anyway, we close them.

## Route

Each ticket is routed to a group of product owners based on the product area. 
Some of our code is covered by a CODEOWNERS file; most is not. GitHub auto-assigns PRs that touch code covered by CODEOWNERS.
