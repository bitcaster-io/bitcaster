# Security


Bitcaster’s development team is strongly committed to responsible reporting and disclosure of security-related issues. 
As such, we’ve adopted and follow a set of policies which conform to that ideal and are geared toward allowing us to 
deliver timely security updates to the official distribution of Bitcaster, as well as to third-party distributions.


## Reporting Security Issues

If you've found a security issue in Bitcaster or in our supported SDKs, 
you can submit your report to security[@]bitcaster.io via email.

Please include as much information as possible in your report to better help us understand and resolve the issue:

- Where the security issue exists (ie. Bitcaster Server, SDK, etc.)
- The type of issue (ex. SQL injection, cross-site scripting, missing authorization, etc.)
- Full paths or links to the source files where the security issue exists, if possible
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof of concept or exploit code, if available

## Data Privacy

our PGP key can be [found on keyservers](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security@bitcaster.io) with the fingerprint:
